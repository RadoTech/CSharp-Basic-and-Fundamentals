Write a console C # program that calculates and prints the value of the following numeric expression:

Note: It is not allowed to calculate the value in advance (for example, using Windows Calculator).

- Find the "static void Main (string [] args)" method and enter its body between {and}.
- Now you need to write the code that calculates the above numeric expression and print its value on the console. Submit the above numeric expression to the brackets of the Console.WriteLine () command:
