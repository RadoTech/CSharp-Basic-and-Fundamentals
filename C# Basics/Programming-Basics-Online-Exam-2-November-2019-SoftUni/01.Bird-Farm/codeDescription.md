• At the beginning of the second and third months he buys more chickens (different quantities)
• At the end of each month, 4% of eggs are married
o The number of eggs should be rounded to the lower integer after the marriage has been removed
• Consider that one month contains exactly 30 days
Input:

       • First price for an egg in pennies - an integer in the range [1… 50]
       • In the second row, the number of chickens in the first month - an integer in the interval [1… 1000]
       • In the third row, the number of chickens to buy at the beginning of the second month - an integer in the interval [1… 50]
       • In the fourth row, the number of chickens to buy at the beginning of the third month - an integer in the interval [1… 50]
