The head of the company notes that more and more employees are spending time on sites that scatter them.
To prevent this, he introduces surprising checks on his employees' open browser tabs.
According to the site, different fines are imposed:
• "Facebook" -> 150 BGN
• "Instagram" -> $ 100
• "Reddit" -> $ 50
Two lines are read from the console:
• Number of tabs open in browser n - integer in the interval [1 ... 10]
• Salary - number in the interval [700 ... 1500]
Then, n - the number of times the website name is read - text
If during the check the salary becomes less than or equal to 0 BGN, the console will be displayed
"You have lost your salary." and the program ends. Otherwise, after checking the console, the rest of the salary (to be written as an integer) is displayed.
