4. Equal pairs:
2 * n-number count is given. The first and second form a pair, the third and fourth also, etc. Each pair has a value - the sum of its constituent numbers. Write a program that checks that all pairs have the same value or prints the maximum difference between two consecutive pairs. If all pairs have the same value, print "Yes, value = {Value}" + the value. Otherwise, print "No, maxdiff = {Difference}" + the maximum difference.
