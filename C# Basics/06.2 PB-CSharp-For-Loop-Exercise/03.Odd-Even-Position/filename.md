3. Odd / Even Positions
Write a program that reads the n-number of numbers entered by the user and calculates the sum, minimum and maximum of the numbers in odd and even positions (count from 1). When there is no minimum / maximum element, print "No".
The output should be formatted as follows:
"OddSum =" + {sum of odd position numbers},
"OddMin =" + {minimum value for odd line numbers} / {"No"},
"OddMax =" + {max value for odd line numbers} / {"No"},
"EvenSum =" + {sum of even positions},
"EvenMin =" + {minimum even number for even positions} / {"No"},
"EvenMax =" + {maximum even number for even positions} / {"No"}
Each number must be formatted to the second character after the decimal point
