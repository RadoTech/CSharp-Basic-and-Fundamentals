6.  Charity campaign*
There is a charity fundraising campaign at the pastry shop that can include pastries from all over the country. 
Initially, we read from the console the number of days the campaign runs and the number of pastries that will be included.
Then, in separate rows, we get the amount of cakes, waffles and pancakes that will be made by one pastry chef in one day.
The following price list should be kept in mind:
• Cake - 45 BGN
• Waffles - 5.80 BGN
• Pancake - 3.20 lv.
1/8 of the final amount will be used to cover product costs during the campaign. 
Write a program that calculates the amount collected at the end of the campaign.
