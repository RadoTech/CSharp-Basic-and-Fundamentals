9. * Aquarium
Lubomir received a parallelepiped aquarium for his birthday. Initially, we read from the console in separate rows its dimensions - length, width and height in inches. It is necessary to calculate how many liters of water the aquarium will collect if it is known that a certain percentage of its capacity is occupied by sand, plants, a heater and a pump.
One liter of water equals one cubic decimeter (1l = 1 dm3).
Write a program that calculates the liters of water needed to fill the tank.
Input:
The console reads 4 lines:
1. Length in cm - integer in the interval [10… 500]
2. Width in cm - integer in the interval [10… 300]
3. Height in cm - integer in the interval [10… 200]
4. Percentage - real number in the range [0.000… 100.000]
Output:
Print one number on the console:
• liters of water that will collect the aquarium formatted to the third decimal place.
Input:
85
75
47
17
Output:
248.689
