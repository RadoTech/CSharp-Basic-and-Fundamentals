7. Area of figures
Write a program in which the user enters the type and size of a geometric figure and calculates its area.
The figures are of four types: square, rectangle, circle and triangle.
The first line of the entry reads the shape of the figure (square, rectangle, circle or triangle). 
If the figure is square, the next line reads an integer - the length of its side.
If the figure is a rectangle, the next two lines read two numbers - the lengths of its sides.
If the figure is a circle, the next line reads a number - the radius of the circle.
If the figure is a triangle, the next two lines read two numbers - the length of its side and the length of the height to it.
Round the result to 3 digits after the decimal point.
Example input and output:
Input:
square
5
Output:
25.000
Input:

6
Output:
113.097
