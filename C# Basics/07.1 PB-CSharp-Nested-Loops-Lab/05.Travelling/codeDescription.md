5. Travelling:
Annie loves to travel and wants to visit several different destinations this year. Choosing a destination will determine how much money it will take to get there and start saving. When she has saved enough, she will be able to travel.
From the console, each destination will read first the destination and the minimum budget that will be needed for the trip.
After that, a few sums will be read, which Annie saves by working and when she manages to raise enough for the trip, she will leave and the console should read:
 "Going to {destination}!"
When she has visited all the destinations she wants, she will type "End" instead of the destination and the program will end.
