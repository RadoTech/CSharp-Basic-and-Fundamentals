12. Clever Lily:
Lily is already N years old. She receives a gift for each of her birthdays. For odd birthdays (1, 3, 5 ... n) she receives toys, and for every even (2, 4, 6 ... n) she receives money. For the second birthday she receives BGN 10.00, the amount is increased by BGN 10.00 for each subsequent even birthday (2 -> 10, 4 -> 20, 6 -> 30 ..., etc.). Over the years, Lily has been secretly saving money. Lily's brother, in the years she receives money, takes 1.00 leva each. Lilly sold toys received over the years, each for P leva and added the amount to the money saved. With money she wanted to buy a washing machine for X leva. Write a program to calculate how much money she has raised and whether she can buy a washing machine.
Input:
The program reads 3 numbers entered by the user in separate lines:
• Lilly's age - an integer in the range [1 ... 77]
• The price of the washing machine - a number in the interval [1.00 ... 10 000.00]
• Single price per toy - integer in the range [0 ... 40]
Output:
Print one line on the console:
• If Lily's money is sufficient:
o “Yes! {N} ”- where N is the balance after the purchase
• If the money is not enough:
o “No! {M} '- where M is the sum that does not reach
• N and M numbers must be formatted to the second decimal place.
