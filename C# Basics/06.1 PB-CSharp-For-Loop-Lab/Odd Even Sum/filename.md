Write a program that reads the n-number of integers given by the user and checks that the sum of the even-numbered numbers is equal to the sum of the odd-numbered numbers. If there are two lines to be printed: "Yes" and a new line "Sum =" + amount; otherwise print "No" and in a new line "Diff =" + the difference. The difference is calculated in absolute value.
